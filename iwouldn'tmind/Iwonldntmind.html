[Verse 1]
Merrily we fall out of line, out of line
I'd fall anywhere with you, I'm by your side
Swinging in the rain, humming melodies
We're not going anywhere until we freeze

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid

[Chorus]
Forever is a long time
But I wouldn't mind spending it by your side

[Verse 2]
Carefully we'll place for our destiny
You came, and you took this heart and set it free
Every word you write or sing is so warm to me, so warm to me
I'm torn, I'm torn to be right where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid

[Chorus]
Forever is a long time
But I wouldn't mind spending it by your side
Tell me everyday I get to wake up to that smile
I wouldn't mind it at all
I wouldn't mind it at all

[Bridge]
You so know me
Pinch me gently
I can hardly breathe

[Chorus]
Forever is a long, long time
But I wouldn't mind spending it by your side
Tell me everyday I get to wake up to that smile
I wouldn't mind it at all
I wouldn't mind it at all
